# Progress

## Milestones
- [x] Site scaffold with modules/capstone/perspectives/competitors/news
- [x] Ingestion pipeline stubbed and functional for starter URLs
- [x] Progress toggle in UI
- [ ] Capstone Rivet skeleton (UI+server+RAG wiring)
- [ ] Evaluation harness baseline

## Features
- [ ] RAG indexing of course docs
- [ ] Rivet flows wired to retrieval and citations
- [ ] News scheduled refresh

## Issues/Risks
- [ ] Image license metadata completeness (internal‑copy policy OK but track sources)
- [ ] Latency/cost unknown until capstone implementation

## Notes
- Internal‑only distribution; ensure attributions remain present

## Review (2025-08-16)
- Summary: Implemented docs structure, ingestion with images and credits, news aggregator, progress UI
- Test/build results: mkdocs build green
