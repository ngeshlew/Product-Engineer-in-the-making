### File-by-file changes

1) `.cursor/rules/webdev-best-practices.mdc` — Added (38 lines)
   - Introduces a web.dev best practices overlay aligned to RIPER Σ modes.
   - Mode overlays with actionable checklists:
     - Research (Ω₁): identify candidate Web APIs (Streams/TransformStream, WebAuthn/passkeys, Service Workers/Manifest, File System Access, Web Share, Badging, Background Sync, App Shortcuts, URL handlers), define progressive enhancement and fallbacks, set p75 performance targets (LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1; optional TTFB ≤ 800ms).
     - Plan (Ω₃): specify PWA strategy (offline, install, update, navigation), manifest requirements (icons, display, shortcuts, scope), define passkey flows with secure defaults (`userVerification: required`, `attestation: none`), plan streaming/backpressure, define RUM schema and sampling.
     - Execute (Ω₄): implement progressive enhancement and service worker caching/offline fallback; use Streams with non-stream fallback; implement passkeys with WebAuthn (challenge rotation, RP ID/origin checks); integrate `web-vitals` with attribution.
     - Review/Test (Ω₄/Ω₅): verify field p75 budgets, validate offline/install/auth flows on multiple browsers and a mid‑tier device profile; use attribution to localize regressions.
   - Adds explicit Performance Budgets (Κ₄ gate addendum) in terms of LCP/INP/CLS p75.
   - Emphasizes feature detection, privacy-respecting telemetry, and stable layouts to avoid CLS.

2) `docs/webdev-integration.md` — Added (160 lines)
   - Full framework for weaving web.dev guidance into RIPER modes.
   - Content highlights:
     - Purpose and curated Sources (streams, passkeys, PWA patterns, Web Vitals).
     - Mode overlays with detailed tasks for Research, Plan, Execute, Test & Measure, Review.
     - Implementation guidance with examples:
       - Progressive enhancement (feature detection for SW, WebAuthn, Streams).
       - Streams pipeline example using `TransformStream` with fallback.
       - WebAuthn passkey registration sketch and server interaction.
       - Web Vitals collection via `web-vitals` with attribution and `sendBeacon`.
     - Checklists for PWA, Performance, Authentication, Files/Clipboard/Share.
     - Notes on user-centric measurement (field p75) and privacy.

3) `README.md` — Modified (+2 / 0 / minor)
   - Adds a new Rules bullet: ``.cursor/rules/webdev-best-practices.mdc`` (web.dev overlay: PWAs, Streams, Passkeys, Web Vitals).
   - Adds a pointer to `docs/webdev-integration.md` for mode checklists and examples.

4) `docs/Structure.md` — Modified (+2 / -1)
   - Clarifies `docs/` description to reference `webdev-integration.md` for mode overlays.

5) `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` — Modified (+24 / -1)
   - Replaces placeholders with concrete architectural guidance:
     - Architecture: PWA app shell (offline/installability); RUM pipeline for Core Web Vitals; progressive enhancement for advanced Web APIs; streaming paths with backpressure.
     - Components: service worker, Web App Manifest, RUM client (`web‑vitals`) and server collector, authentication via passkeys with fallback, capability layer for file/clipboard/share.
     - Data/Integrations: enumerates Web APIs and observability stack (web‑vitals, Lighthouse, field aggregation/dashboard).
     - Key Decisions: budgets at p75, prefer passkeys with secure defaults, use streaming for large payloads with fallback, enforce progressive enhancement.
     - Tradeoffs: platform variance for passkeys, Streams complexity, SW update complexity/versioning UX, telemetry privacy/sampling balance.

6) `memory-bank/techContext.md` — Modified (+23 / -3)
   - Improves technical context with:
     - Technology Stack: enumerates key Web APIs and observability tools.
     - Environment: target evergreen browsers; include mid‑tier device profile.
     - Dependencies/Libraries: `web-vitals` for LCP/INP/CLS with attribution.
     - Performance & Metrics: Core Web Vitals p75 targets, TTFB guardrail, lab TBT; measurement via RUM sampling and Lighthouse/throttling.

## PR #4 — Add Microsoft Clarity analytics integration and documentation

- Commit: `5982e12e3822359a802a79c6cb38e3d25aad7c99`

### File-by-file changes

1) `.cursor/rules/analytics-clarity.mdc` — Added (36 lines)
   - Mode-aware analytics standards for Microsoft Clarity:
     - Research (Ω₁): study docs and existing analytics; produce “Telemetry Research” in `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (event taxonomy, tags, masking, consent approach).
     - Innovate (Ω₂): propose event names; decide Smart Events vs `clarity("event", ...)`.
     - Plan (Ω₃): include acceptance checks—snippet location, SPA `clarity("page")`, `identify` strategy, consent gating, events+tags, masking via `data-clarity-mask="true"`, verification steps (dashboard live sessions, network POSTs to `clarity.ms/collect`).
     - Execute (Ω₄): implement snippet with project id; wire SPA route change; emit events/tags; apply masking; honor consent.
     - Review (Ω₅): verify installation, Smart Events, custom events; export a sample via Data Export API; record findings in `memory-bank/progress.md`.
   - Points to `docs/analytics/Clarity.md` for deeper guidance.

2) `docs/analytics/Clarity.md` — Added (169 lines)
   - Comprehensive Clarity integration guide:
     - Why Clarity and key docs (Smart Events, setup, API, Identify, Data Export, verification, integrations).
     - Mode-aware plan mapped to RIPER (Research/Innovate/Plan/Execute/Review).
     - Implementation checklist with code:
       - Install head snippet with `PROJECT_ID`.
       - SPA navigation hook: `window.clarity("page")`.
       - Identify API: `window.clarity("identify", userId)` (prefer pseudonymous IDs).
       - Session/page tagging via `clarity("set", key, value)`.
       - Custom events via `clarity("event", name)`.
       - Consent gating: `clarity("consent", true)` after consent.
       - Masking via `data-clarity-mask="true"`.
       - Verification steps (dashboard + network `collect`).
       - Data Export API example curl and guidance.
     - Recommended event taxonomy (page_view, signup/checkout flow, errors, experiments) and naming rules.
