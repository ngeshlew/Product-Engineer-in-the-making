why_for_designers: Establishes patterns to control complex multi‑step/agent flows with guardrails; align UX affordances (status, retries) to orchestration.
bot_application: Model multi‑node flows (retrieve‑plan‑act‑review), surface state transitions in UI, and add quality loops to prevent off‑policy behavior.

> Synthesis: LangGraph frames LLM apps as controllable cognitive architectures: single/multi‑agent, sequential or hierarchical. Use it when features require clear state transitions, tool orchestration, and guardrails.

## Controllable cognitive architecture for any task
LangGraph's flexible framework supports diverse control flows â single agent, multi-agent, hierarchical, sequential â and robustly handles realistic, complex scenarios.
Ensure reliability with easy-to-add moderation and quality loops that prevent agents from veering off course.
Use LangGraph Platform to templatize your cognitive architecture so that tools, prompts, and models are easily configurable with LangGraph Platform Assistants.
